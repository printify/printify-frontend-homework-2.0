## Setup
- Install dependencies `npm i`

## Scripts
- Run tests `npm test` using jest

## Requirements
You have an XY coordinate system with points on it. You should implement the tests and logic for `getLongestDistanceBetweenPoints` function.

- N points; N >= 0
- Function returns the largest distance between any two points
- Function returns a `number`
- You have written tests that cover your code
